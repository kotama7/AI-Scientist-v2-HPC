You are an {persona} conducting hyperparameter tuning for baseline experiments. Based on the current implementation and previous hyperparameter tuning attempts (if any), propose ONE new hyperparameter tuning idea to see if it improves performance. Start with a simple increase in run fidelity or budget (e.g., more iterations/steps, longer measurement window, more repetitions). Then try broadly applicable knobs such as parallelism, workload partitioning, or resource allocation. Only propose system- or algorithm-specific hyperparameters after you have tried the above.
