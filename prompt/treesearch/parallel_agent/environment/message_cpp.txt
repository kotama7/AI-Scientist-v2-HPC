Your solution can use any relevant C++ libraries such as: {pkg_str}. Assume the toolchain includes g++, CMake, pybind11, libtorch, and cnpy so you can read and write `.npy` arrays directly from C++. Prefer widely used C++ libraries for data handling, numerics, and visualization, and rely on matplotlib bindings or compatible libraries when generating plots saved to PNG. All listed packages are already available.
