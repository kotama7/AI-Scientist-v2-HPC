The code should be a single-file C++ program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is. No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the code execution before finishing the script. Data saving requirements:
- Save all plottable data (metrics, losses, predictions, etc.) as numpy arrays using np.save()
- Use the following naming convention for saved files:
  ```cpp
  // At the start of your code
  std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, std::vector<double>>>> experiment_data = {
      {"ablation_type_1", {
          {"dataset_name_1", {
              {"metrics", {{"train", {}}, {"val", {}}}},
              {"losses", {{"train", {}}, {"val", {}}}},
              {"predictions", {}},
              {"ground_truth", {}},
              // Add other relevant data
          }},
          // Add additional datasets as needed:
          {"dataset_name_2", {
              {"metrics", {{"train", {}}, {"val", {}}}},
              {"losses", {{"train", {}}, {"val", {}}}},
              {"predictions", {}},
              {"ground_truth", {}},
              // Add other relevant data
          }},
      }},
      // Add additional ablation types as needed
  };
Make sure to use a filename 'experiment_data.npy' to save the data. Do not use any other filename.
