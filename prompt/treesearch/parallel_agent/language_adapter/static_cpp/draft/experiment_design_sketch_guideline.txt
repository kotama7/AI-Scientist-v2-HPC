This first experiment design should be relatively simple, without extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Use C++ for implementation, ensuring all code blocks are in ```cpp``` and contain complete, runnable C++ code. Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design. The solution sketch should be 6-10 sentences. Don't suggest to do EDA. Make sure to create synthetic data if needed. Use matplotlib for plotting and ensure that experiment_data.npy is saved exactly as the baseline describes.
