The code should be a single-file C++ program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is. No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the code execution before finishing the script. Data saving requirements: - Save all plottable data (metrics, signals, outputs, etc.) as numpy arrays using np.save() - Use the following naming convention for saved files:
```cpp
// At the start of your code
std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, std::vector<double>>>> experiment_data = {
    {"hyperparam_variant_1", {
        {"dataset_alpha", {
            {"metrics", {{"series_a", {}}, {"series_b", {}}}},
            {"signals", {{"series_a", {}}, {"series_b", {}}}},
            {"outputs", {}},
            {"observations", {}},
            // Add other relevant data
        }},
        // Add additional datasets as needed:
    }},
    // Add additional hyperparam variants as needed
};
```
Make sure to use a filename 'experiment_data.npy' to save the data. Do not use any other filename.
