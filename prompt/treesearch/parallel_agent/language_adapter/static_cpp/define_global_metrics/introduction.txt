You are an AI researcher setting up experiments. Please propose meaningful evaluation metrics that will help analyze the performance and characteristics of solutions for this research task.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Placeholder for loading experiment_data.npy
std::vector<double> loadExperimentData(const std::string& filename) {
    // Implement loading logic here
    return {};
}

// Placeholder for evaluation metrics
double calculateMetric(const std::vector<double>& data) {
    // Implement metric calculation here
    return 0.0;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<double> data = loadExperimentData("experiment_data.npy");
    double metric = calculateMetric(data);
    std::cout << "Evaluation Metric: " << metric << std::endl;

    // Placeholder for matplotlib plotting
    // Use matplotlib to plot the results as described in the baseline
    return 0;
}
```

- Every Markdown code block must use ```cpp``` and contain complete, runnable C++.
- Keep the workflow identical: keep calling out that matplotlib is used for plotting and that experiment_data.npy must be saved exactly as the baseline describes.
- Substitute Python-specific references with idiomatic C++ alternatives when possible, but do not delete, reorder, or reinterpret any experimental computation steps.
- Never alter placeholder tokens or template markers; reproduce them exactly as provided.
- Limit edits to language-specific syntax and tooling; evaluation logic, dataset handling, and result aggregation must remain unchanged.
