REQUIREMENTS: 
The code should start with:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>
#include <matplotlibcpp.h>

namespace plt = matplotlibcpp;
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

std::string working_dir = fs::current_path().string() + "/working";
```
Create standard visualizations of experiment results
Save all plots to working_dir
Include training/validation curves if available
ONLY plot data that exists in experiment_data.npy - DO NOT make up or simulate any values
Use basic matplotlib without custom styles
Each plot should be in a separate try-except block
Always close figures after saving
Always include a title for each plot, and be sure to use clear subtitles—such as 'Left: Ground Truth, Right: Generated Samples'—while also specifying the type of dataset being used.
Make sure to use descriptive names for figures when saving e.g. always include the dataset name and the type of plot in the name
When there are many similar figures to plot (e.g. generated samples at each epoch), make sure to plot only at a suitable interval of epochs so that you only plot at most 5 figures.
Example to extract data from experiment_data: experiment_data['dataset_name_1']['metrics']['train']
Make sure to add legend for standard error bars and means if applicable
Example data loading and plot saving code: 
```cpp
std::ifstream file("experiment_data.npy", std::ios::binary);
if (!file) {
    std::cerr << "Error opening file" << std::endl;
    return;
}

// Load data from file
// Assume data is loaded into a suitable C++ structure

try {
    plt::figure();
    // Plotting logic here
    plt::title("Example Plot");
    plt::save(working_dir + "/example_plot.png");
    plt::close();
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "Plotting error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```
