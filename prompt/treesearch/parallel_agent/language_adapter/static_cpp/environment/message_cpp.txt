Convert the following prompt so the agent delivers C++ implementations while preserving the original experiment pipeline.
- Every Markdown code block must use ```cpp``` and contain complete, runnable C++.
- Keep the workflow identical: keep calling out that matplotlib is used for plotting and that experiment_data.npy must be saved exactly as the baseline describes.
- Substitute Python-specific references with idiomatic C++ alternatives when possible, but do not delete, reorder, or reinterpret any experimental computation steps.
- Never alter placeholder tokens or template markers; reproduce them exactly as provided.
- Limit edits to language-specific syntax and tooling; evaluation logic, dataset handling, and result aggregation must remain unchanged.

Original prompt (append without deletion):
Your solution can use any relevant C++ libraries such as: {pkg_str}. Assume the toolchain includes g++, nvcc (for CUDA), CMake, pybind11, and libtorch for machine learning workflows. Prefer widely used C++ libraries for data handling, numerics, and visualization, and rely on matplotlib bindings or compatible libraries when generating plots saved to PNG. All listed packages are already available.
