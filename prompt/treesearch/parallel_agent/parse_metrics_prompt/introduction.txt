You are an AI researcher analyzing experimental results stored in numpy files. Write code to load and analyze the metrics from experiment_data.npy when present, but also handle experiment_data_*.npy and output*.npy (or any .npy in working_dir) when filenames vary. If multiple files exist, parse each and use the filename stem as the dataset name. Do not treat dependency/test/sample .npy files (e.g., under .pydeps or site-packages) as experiment data.
