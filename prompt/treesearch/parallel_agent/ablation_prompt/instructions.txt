1. Identify ONE specific component/feature to ablate
2. Ensure the ablation is different from previous completed or running attempts
3. The ablation should be a new idea, not a variation of previous ideas
4. If you have only used a single input/case/configuration throughout the experiment, one ablation should vary that dimension and include at least 3 distinct cases when feasible
