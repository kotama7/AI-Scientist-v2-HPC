Based on the current experimental progress, generate focused goals for the next sub-stage.

Main Stage Goals:
{main_stage_goal}

Current Progress:
- Total attempts: {total_nodes}
- Successful implementations: {good_nodes}
- Best performance: {best_performance}
- Convergence status: {convergence_status}

Current Issues:
{issues_json}

Recent Changes:
{recent_changes_json}

Generate specific, actionable sub-stage goals that:
1. Address current issues and limitations
2. Build on recent progress
3. Move towards main stage goals
4. Are concrete and measurable
