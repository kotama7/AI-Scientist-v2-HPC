Evaluate if stage 2 (baseline tuning) is complete based on the following evidence:

1. Figure Analysis:
{vlm_feedback}

2. Datasets/Cases Tested: {datasets_tested}

Requirements for completion:
1. Evidence shows stable, repeatable behavior for the target objective
2. Results are tested across multiple representative inputs/cases/configurations when applicable
3. Outputs and plots are coherent, consistent, and free of major gaps

Provide a detailed evaluation of completion status.
