Evaluate whether the current experimental stage should progress to the next stage.
Consider all available evidence holistically:

Current Stage Information:
- Name: {stage_name}
- Description: {stage_description}
- Goals: {stage_goals}

Performance Metrics:
{metrics_json}

Identified Issues:
{issues_json}

Progress Analysis:
{progress_json}

Expected Stage Progression:
1. Initial Implementation: Focus on basic working implementation
2. Baseline Tuning: Systematic optimization of core parameters
3. Creative Research: Novel improvements and approaches
4. Ablation Studies: Systematic component analysis

Consider factors like:
- Progress toward stage goals
- Performance trends and stability
- Quality and reliability of results
- Understanding of the problem
- Presence of systematic issues
- Convergence indicators
- Readiness for next stage challenges

Provide a holistic evaluation of whether the experiment should:
1. Progress to next stage
2. Continue current stage with specific focus
3. Extend current stage with modifications
