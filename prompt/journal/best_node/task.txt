Select the best experimental variant from the candidates below, considering all available evidence. Avoid relying too heavily on any single metric if it is not directly comparable across variants (e.g., different objectives or evaluation protocols). If there are multiple evaluation metrics or datasets, weigh overall performance, consistency, and tradeoffs to choose the strongest variant.
