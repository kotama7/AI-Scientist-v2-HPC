You are provided with a 3-tier memory system containing all research data. Your task is to autonomously search through this memory and extract relevant information to generate comprehensive paper sections.

## Memory Structure

The memory is organized into three tiers:
1. **Core Memory**: Key-value pairs of essential context (always-injected information)
2. **Recall Memory**: Event timeline recording what happened during research
3. **Archival Memory**: Long-term storage with detailed information (tagged entries)

## Memory Data

{memory_summary}

## Instructions

Analyze the memory data above and generate content for each paper section. You should:

1. **Search Core Memory** for:
   - phase0_summary (experimental setup)
   - results, experimental_results (quantitative outcomes)
   - Any other relevant key-value context

2. **Search Recall Memory** for:
   - node_created events (method changes)
   - node_result events (experimental outcomes)
   - error_encountered events (failures and debugging)
   - metric_extracted events (performance metrics)

3. **Search Archival Memory** for:
   - Entries tagged with IDEA_MD or ROOT_IDEA (research idea)
   - Entries tagged with PHASE0_INTERNAL (detailed setup)
   - Entries tagged with code:* (implementation details)
   - Entries tagged with results:* (detailed results)
   - Any other relevant archived information

## Required Output Sections

Return a JSON object with these keys (use snake_case):

- `title_candidates`: Suggested paper titles based on the research
- `abstract_material`: Key points for the abstract
- `problem_statement`: Research problem and motivation
- `hypothesis`: Research hypothesis being tested
- `method`: Methodology and approach
- `experimental_setup`: Hardware, software, and experimental configuration
- `phase0_internal_info_summary`: Summary of phase 0 planning
- `results`: Quantitative results and findings
- `ablations_negative`: Ablation studies and negative results
- `failure_modes_timeline`: Failures encountered and how they were addressed
- `threats_to_validity`: Potential threats to the validity of results
- `reproducibility_checklist`: Steps needed to reproduce the research
- `narrative_bullets`: Key narrative points for the paper

## Guidelines

- Extract and synthesize ALL relevant information from the memory
- Do NOT limit the length of any section - include all relevant details
- If information is not found in memory, indicate "Not found in memory"
- Be comprehensive - this is for generating a complete research paper
- Preserve technical details, metrics, and specific values

Return ONLY a valid JSON object, no additional text or markdown formatting.
