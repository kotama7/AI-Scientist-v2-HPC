Write the content for the following paper section using ONLY the provided memory slice.

Section Spec (JSON):
{section_spec}

Memory Slice (JSON):
{memory_slice}

Guidelines:
- Use only the memory slice; do not invent details.
- Extract relevant information from ALL parts of the memory slice: core_memory, recall_memory, and archival_memory.
- For hardware/environment sections: carefully extract CPU model, sockets, cores, NUMA topology, OS, compiler, and tools from archival entries (especially those tagged PHASE0_INTERNAL) and core_memory keys (hardware_cpu, hardware_os, hardware_compiler, hardware_tools).
- If relevant info is missing after checking all memory sources, say "Not found in memory." succinctly.
- Return plain markdown text (no JSON).
