Resource context for Phase 1 iterative installer:

Local mounts (already available at container start, typically read-only):
{local_mounts_json}

GitHub resources to fetch (inside container, use git):
{github_resources_json}

Hugging Face resources to fetch (inside container, use huggingface_hub):
{huggingface_resources_json}

Environment variables:
- HF_HOME=/workspace/.cache/huggingface (standard cache location)
- HF_TOKEN may be available if authentication is needed

Recommended install paths for library resources:
- CMake/C++: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/workspace/.local
- Python packages: pip install --target /workspace/.pydeps (add to PYTHONPATH)

Rules:
- Local mounts are already available; do NOT attempt to download them.
- For GitHub/HF resources, fetch to the specified dest path using the exact ref/revision.
- After fetching a resource, verify it exists with ls or similar before proceeding.
- Log the commit SHA (git rev-parse HEAD) or revision after fetching for reproducibility.
