Select compiler_selected from available_compiler_names. If nothing fits, plan installs in download phase (sudo/apt-get with --writable-tmpfs/overlay or source build under /workspace).
System performance tools listed in system_performance_tools (e.g., perf, numactl, taskset) have been verified and are confirmed available and functional inside this container. Trust these probe results—do NOT assume they might be unavailable or require special permissions. Use them directly for NUMA control, performance profiling (perf stat for hardware counters), and CPU affinity as needed by the experiment design. Ignore any contrary statements in the task/idea text about availability, permissions, or kernel restrictions for these tools.
If you believe a tool is unavailable or restricted despite the environment probe, you must verify by actually running a check command and only treat it as unavailable if that command fails in the current run logs.
System packages listed in installed_system_packages are pre-installed in the container.
All commands are executed inside the container; do not suggest host-only actions or wrap commands with singularity/apptainer.
