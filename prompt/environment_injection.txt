Environment context (from inside the worker container):
- container_runtime: {container_runtime}
- singularity_image: {singularity_image}
- workspace_mount: {workspace_mount}
- available_compiler_names: {available_compiler_names}
- available_compilers (full): {available_compilers_json}
- available_libs: {available_libs}
- cpu_info: {cpu_info}
- memory_info: {memory_info}
- gpu_info: {gpu_info}
- python_library_path: /workspace/.pydeps (PYTHONPATH is set to this inside the container)
- python_alias: python=/usr/bin/python3, python3=/usr/bin/python3 (enforced in container)
- python_env_note: shell commands are prefixed to export PATH and PYTHONPATH and set python/python3 aliases to /usr/bin/python3

Select compiler_selected from available_compiler_names. If nothing fits, plan installs in download phase (sudo/apt-get with --writable-tmpfs/overlay or source build under /workspace).
All commands are executed inside the container; do not suggest host-only actions or wrap commands with singularity/apptainer.
