Evaluate if stage 4 (component/variant studies) is complete based on the following evidence:

1. Figure Analysis:
{vlm_feedback}

2. Variations Completed: {ablation_names}

Requirements for completion:
1. At least one successful variation run with valid metrics and plots
2. When feasible, results cover more than one distinct variation or case
3. Outputs and plots are coherent, consistent, and free of major gaps

Provide a detailed evaluation of completion status.
