Based on the above comprehensive analysis, determine the appropriate configuration for the next experimental stage. Consider:
1. Visual analysis insights from plots
2. Individual node performance and patterns
3. Overall progress and convergence status
4. Identified issues and challenges

Include:
1. Stage name (brief, descriptive)
2. Detailed description of the stage's purpose
3. Specific, measurable goals
4. Maximum iterations needed
5. Success metric threshold (if applicable)
