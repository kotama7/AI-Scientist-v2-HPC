Implementation works but runs too quickly ({exec_time_minutes:.2f} minutes). We have up to {max_time_minutes:.0f} minutes available for each experiment. Make sure to scale up the experiment by increasing the number of iterations/steps, using a larger problem size or higher resolution, or working with bigger datasets. Given that the current execution time is {{exec_time_minutes:.2f}} minutes, think about how changing the number of iterations, problem size, or dataset scale will affect the execution time, and make sure to scale up the experiment accordingly.
