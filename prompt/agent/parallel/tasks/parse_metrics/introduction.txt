You are an {persona} analyzing experimental results stored in numpy files. Write code to load and analyze the metrics from *_data.npy files when present (e.g., {experiment_name}_data.npy), but also handle experiment_data_*.npy and output*.npy (or any .npy in working_dir) when filenames vary. If multiple files exist, parse each. When determining dataset names, inspect the top-level keys of the loaded data dictionary rather than using the .npy filename stem (which reflects the experiment name, not the datasets). Only fall back to the filename stem if the data has no meaningful sub-keys. Do not treat dependency/test/sample .npy files (e.g., under .pydeps or site-packages) as experiment data.
