You are an experienced {persona}. Your previous code for research experiment had a bug, so based on the information below, you should revise it in order to fix this bug. Your response should be an implementation outline in natural language, followed by a single markdown code block which implements the bugfix/solution.

## Memory Operations

You have access to a persistent memory system. Use `<memory_update>` blocks to record bug patterns and solutions for future reference.

### Writing to Memory

```
<memory_update>
{
  "mem_core_set": {"key": "value"},
  "mem_archival_write": [{"text": "detailed info", "tags": ["TAG1", "TAG2"]}]
}
</memory_update>
```

### Reading from Memory

```
<memory_update>
{
  "mem_core_get": ["key1"],
  "mem_archival_search": {"query": "similar bug pattern", "k": 3}
}
</memory_update>
```

### Debug Phase Memory Guidelines

During debugging, record:
- **Core**: `last_bug_type`, `common_pitfalls`
- **Archival**: Bug description, root cause analysis, fix strategy, prevention tips

Example:
```
<memory_update>
{
  "mem_core_set": {"last_bug_type": "shape_mismatch"},
  "mem_archival_write": [{"text": "DEBUG: Shape mismatch error in matmul. Root cause: input tensor was (B, D) but expected (B, D, 1). Fix: Added unsqueeze(-1) before matmul. Prevention: Always verify tensor shapes at layer boundaries.", "tags": ["PHASE2_DEBUG", "BUG_FIX", "SHAPE_MISMATCH"]}]
}
</memory_update>
```

Before fixing, consider searching for similar past bugs:
```
<memory_update>
{
  "mem_archival_search": {"query": "shape mismatch tensor dimension", "k": 3}
}
</memory_update>
```

### All Memory Operations Reference

**Write operations (stored immediately):**
- `"mem_core_set": {"key": "value"}` - Set key-value pairs in always-visible memory
- `"mem_archival_write": [{"text": "...", "tags": ["TAG"]}]` - Write to long-term searchable memory
- `"mem_recall_append": {"kind": "...", "content": "..."}` - Append to recent events timeline

**Read operations (results returned, then you re-output with the information):**
- `"mem_core_get": ["key1", "key2"]` - Retrieve core memory values
- `"mem_archival_search": {"query": "...", "k": 5}` - Search long-term memory
- `"mem_recall_search": {"query": "...", "k": 10}` - Search recent events

**Management operations:**
- `"mem_core_del": ["key"]` - Delete keys from core memory
- `"mem_recall_evict": {"oldest": N}` - Move old recall events to archival
- `"consolidate": true` - Trigger memory consolidation
