Your solution can use any relevant Fortran libraries such as: {pkg_str}. Assume the toolchain includes gfortran, ifort (Intel Fortran), and nvfortran (for GPU code). Use BLAS/LAPACK for linear algebra, OpenMP for parallelization, and MPI for distributed computing. For outputting `.npy` arrays from Fortran, use cnpy bindings or write binary data compatible with NumPy format. All listed packages are already available.
