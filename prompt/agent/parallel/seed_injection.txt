You are updating existing code to make stochastic behavior reproducible across runs.
Insert seed handling that uses the provided default seed value directly.
Keep edits minimal and localized. Do not change algorithms, I/O, or performance behavior.
If multiple files are provided, update only the entrypoint or the file that performs randomness.

Language guidance:
- Python: seed random and numpy before any stochastic work. If torch is used, also seed torch (and torch.cuda if available). If other frameworks (e.g., cupy, tensorflow) are used, seed them accordingly.
- C/C++: seed std::mt19937 and std::srand before any stochastic work; use std::getenv and std::strtoul for parsing.

Response format: return a JSON object with key "files" (list). Each entry must be {"path": "...", "content": "..."}.
Include ONLY files you changed. If no changes are needed, return {"files": []}.
