AVAILABLE DATA:
- Primary: experiment_data.npy in working_dir
- Also: experiment_data_*.npy or output*.npy (and any other .npy) in working_dir or subfolders
REQUIREMENTS: 
The code should start with:
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import os
  import glob
  working_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'working')
Return only runnable Python code (no JSON or schemas).
Create standard visualizations of experiment results
Save all plots to working_dir
If experiment_data.npy is missing, enumerate available .npy files (prefer experiment_data*.npy and output*.npy) and load each file; when multiple files exist, treat each filename stem as a dataset name in plot titles and filenames.
Dynamically discover plottable metrics by introspecting the data structure. Iterate over available keys and identify numeric arrays or time series suitable for plotting.
ONLY plot data that exists in the available .npy files - DO NOT make up or simulate any values
Use basic matplotlib without custom styles
Each plot should be in a separate try-except block
Always close figures after saving
Always include a title for each plot, and be sure to use clear subtitles—such as 'Left: Ground Truth, Right: Generated Samples'—while also specifying the type of dataset being used.
Make sure to use descriptive names for figures when saving e.g. always include the dataset name and the type of plot in the name
When there are many similar figures to plot (e.g. generated samples at each epoch), make sure to plot only at a suitable interval of epochs so that you only plot at most 5 figures.
