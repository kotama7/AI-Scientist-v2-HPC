REQUIREMENTS: 
The code should start with:
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import os
  import glob
  working_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'working')
Return only runnable Python code (no JSON or schemas).
Create standard visualizations of experiment results
Save all plots to working_dir
Dynamically discover plottable metrics by introspecting the data structure. Iterate over available keys and identify numeric arrays or time series suitable for plotting.
ONLY plot data that exists in the available .npy files - DO NOT make up or simulate any values
Use basic matplotlib without custom styles
Each plot should be in a separate try-except block
Always close figures after saving
Always include a title for each plot, and be sure to use clear subtitles—such as 'Left: Reference, Right: Result' or 'Left: Input, Right: Output'—while also specifying the type of dataset being used.
Make sure to use descriptive names for figures when saving e.g. always include the dataset name and the type of plot in the name
When there are many similar figures to plot (e.g. intermediate results at each iteration), make sure to plot only at a suitable interval so that you only plot at most 5 figures.
CRITICAL: If the "Experiment Data Path" section is provided, you MUST use those exact absolute paths in experiment_data_path_list. Do NOT search working_dir when paths are provided. Only fallback to searching working_dir if NO paths are given.
Introspect experiment_data structure to find available keys - do not assume specific key names. Example: iterate over experiment_data.keys() to discover available datasets and metrics.
Make sure to add legend for standard error bars and means if applicable
