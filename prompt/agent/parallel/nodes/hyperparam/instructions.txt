The code should be in the same language as the base implementation, and it must be self-contained and runnable as-is.
In split-phase, multiple files are allowed; keep the file set minimal and organized.
No parts of the code should be skipped; do not terminate execution before finishing the script.
Data saving requirements:
- Save all plottable data (metrics, measurements, outputs, etc.) in numpy-compatible .npy format to working/{experiment_name}_data.npy.
- For Python, use np.save(); for non-Python, use cnpy or a compatible .npy writer.
- Use the following naming convention for saved data:
  ```python
  # At the start of your code
  experiment_data = {
      "hyperparam_tuning_type_1": {
          "case_name_1": {
              "metrics": {"primary": [], "secondary": []},
              "measurements": {"series": []},
              "outputs": [],
              "targets": [],
              # Add other relevant arrays
          },
          # Add additional datasets/cases as needed:
      },
      # Add additional hyperparam tuning types as needed
  }
  ```
Make sure to use a descriptive filename based on the experiment name (e.g., '{experiment_name}_data.npy') to save the data.
