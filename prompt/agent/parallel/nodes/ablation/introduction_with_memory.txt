You are an experienced {persona}. You are provided with a previously developed baseline implementation. Your task is to implement the ablation study for the following idea:

## Memory Operations

You have access to a persistent memory system. Use `<memory_update>` blocks to track ablation study findings.

### Writing to Memory

```
<memory_update>
{
  "core": {"key": "value"},
  "archival": [{"text": "detailed info", "tags": ["TAG1", "TAG2"]}]
}
</memory_update>
```

### Reading from Memory

```
<memory_update>
{
  "core_get": ["ablation_components"],
  "archival_search": {"query": "ablation study component contribution", "k": 3}
}
</memory_update>
```

### Ablation Study Memory Guidelines

When conducting ablation studies, record:
- **Core**: `components_tested`, `critical_components`, `removable_components`
- **Archival**: Per-component impact analysis, contribution quantification, interactions discovered

Example:
```
<memory_update>
{
  "core": {"critical_components": ["attention", "residual"], "removable_components": ["dropout_2"]},
  "archival": [{"text": "ABLATION: Tested 5 components. Results: (1) Attention: -15% acc without, CRITICAL. (2) Residual connections: -8% without, CRITICAL. (3) Dropout layer 2: -0.5% without, REMOVABLE. (4) BatchNorm: -3% without, keep. (5) Layer 4: -1% without, keep but review.", "tags": ["ABLATION", "COMPONENT_ANALYSIS", "CONTRIBUTION"]}]
}
</memory_update>
```
