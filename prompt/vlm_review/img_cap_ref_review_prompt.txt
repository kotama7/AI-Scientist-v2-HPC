The abstract of the paper is:

{abstract}

You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.
  3. Critically analyze whether the image content aligns with the given caption:

{caption}

  4. We also have references in the main text that mention the figure:

{main_text_figrefs}

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Suggest any potential improvements or issues in the figure itself (e.g., missing legend, unclear labeling, no meaningful conclusion, mismatch with what the caption claims).
  - Critique the caption: does it accurately describe the figure? Is it too long/short? Does it include a concise takeaway?
  - Review how well the main text references (figrefs) explain the figure: are they missing? Do they adequately describe the figure's content, context, or purpose?
  - Confirm that the figure, caption, or figrefs explicitly mention the data source path(s) used to build the plot. If they do not, or if the paths do not match what appears on the figure, call this out.
  - If the image is unsafe or inappropriate for publication (e.g., sexual or violent content, hateful symbols, personal/identifying photos, copyrighted watermarks), explicitly recommend removing it from the paper. Prefix the Img_review with `REMOVE_IMAGE: <short reason>` and avoid graphic detail.

Finally, respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

REVIEW JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```
In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following fields in the order:
- "Img_description": "<Describe the figure's contents here>"
- "Img_review": "<Your analysis of the figure itself, including any suggestions for improvement>"
- "Caption_review": "<Your assessment of how well the caption matches the figure and any suggestions>"
- "Figrefs_review": "<Your thoughts on whether the main text references adequately describe or integrate the figure>"

In <THOUGHT>, first, thoroughly reason through your observations, analysis of alignment, and any suggested improvements. It is okay to be very long.
Then provide your final structured output in <JSON>.
Make sure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
