You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Suggest any potential improvements or issues in the figure itself (e.g., missing legend, unclear labeling, no meaningful conclusion, mismatch with what the caption claims).
  - Verify that the figure or any accompanying text explicitly lists the data source path(s) used to generate it (e.g., "Loaded data: <path>"). If the path is missing, unclear, or inconsistent with the visualized data, flag it in your review.

Finally, respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

REVIEW JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```
In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following fields in the order:
- "Img_description": "<Describe the figure's contents here>"
- "Img_review": "<Your analysis of the figure itself, including any suggestions for improvement>"

In <THOUGHT>, first, thoroughly reason through your observations, analysis of alignment, and any suggested improvements. It is okay to be very long.
Then provide your final structured output in <JSON>.
Make sure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
